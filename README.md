# Tatvasoft
This is file structure of my Tatvasoft Internship :
DAY 1 - postgresql.sql   
DAY 2 - |--form.component.chtml
        |--form.component.ts
        |--app.component.chtml
        |--app.component.ts   [I have built the Student Form component to enter the student's name, roll number, and marks (out of 150) using interpolation and binding. It also calculates the grade based on the marks and displays the data in a table format.]
